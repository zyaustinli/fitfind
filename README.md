## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Gemini API key for image analysis |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | Yes | SerpAPI key for shopping search |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | OpenAI API key (for future features) |

### Application Settings

You can modify these settings in `app.py`:

- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum file upload size (default: 16MB)
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for uploaded images
- `RESULTS_FOLDER`: Directory for processing results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No API key" errors**:
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Check that API keys are correctly formatted
   - Restart the application after adding keys

2. **Image upload fails**:
   - Check file size (must be < 16MB)
   - Ensure file format is supported (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
   - Check network connection

3. **No search results**:
   - Try uploading a clearer image with distinct clothing items
   - Use the "Improve Search Results" feature with specific feedback
   - Check that SerpAPI key is valid and has remaining quota

4. **Server errors**:
   - Check the console output for detailed error messages
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Verify API keys are valid

### Performance Tips

- Use high-quality, well-lit images for best results
- Images with clear, distinct clothing items work better
- Avoid images with too many overlapping or obscured items
- The first search may take 30-60 seconds due to AI processing

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default, which provides:
- Automatic reloading when files change
