# FitFind Supabase Storage Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation migrates FitFind from local file storage to Supabase Storage for uploaded outfit images. This solution provides:

- ✅ **Scalable Storage**: CDN-delivered images with global availability
- ✅ **Security**: Row-level security policies for user data protection
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Anonymous images are cleaned up after 24 hours
- ✅ **Public URLs**: Direct image access without authentication concerns

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `image_storage_service.py` - Supabase Storage service implementation
- `supabase_storage_setup.sql` - Database schema and policies setup
- `verify_storage_setup.sql` - Verification queries for setup
- `test_storage.py` - Storage service health tests
- `test_storage_endpoints.py` - API endpoint integration tests
- `STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `app.py` - Updated upload endpoint and added storage management endpoints
- Enhanced `/api/upload` with Supabase Storage integration
- Added `/api/storage/cleanup` endpoint
- Added `/api/storage/status` endpoint 
- Enhanced `/api/health` endpoint with storage status

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Execute `supabase_storage_setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- This will create:
   -- - outfit-images storage bucket
   -- - Storage access policies
   -- - storage_path column in search_sessions table
   -- - Necessary indexes
   ```

2. Verify setup with `verify_storage_setup.sql`

### Step 2: Test Storage Service
```bash
# Test storage service connectivity
python test_storage.py
```

### Step 3: Test API Integration
```bash
# Start your Flask server
python app.py

# In another terminal, test the endpoints
python test_storage_endpoints.py
```

### Step 4: Frontend Verification
1. Upload a new image through the frontend
2. Check that the response includes a Supabase Storage URL
3. Navigate to the history tab
4. Verify the uploaded image displays correctly

## How It Works

### Image Upload Flow
1. **Frontend Upload**: User uploads image via `/api/upload`
2. **Supabase Storage**: Image uploaded to appropriate folder:
   - Authenticated users: `{user_id}/{file_id}.{ext}`
   - Anonymous users: `anonymous/{file_id}.{ext}`
3. **Database Record**: Session created with public Supabase URL
4. **Local Processing**: Image temporarily saved locally for AI processing
5. **Cleanup**: Temporary local file removed after processing

### Storage Organization
```
outfit-images/
├── {user_id_1}/
│   ├── {file_id_1}.jpg
│   └── {file_id_2}.png
├── {user_id_2}/
│   └── {file_id_3}.jpg
└── anonymous/
    ├── {file_id_4}.jpg  # Auto-deleted after 24h
    └── {file_id_5}.png  # Auto-deleted after 24h
```

### Security Policies
- **Authenticated Users**: Can only access their own images
- **Anonymous Users**: Can view anonymous folder images
- **Public Bucket**: Images are publicly accessible via direct URL
- **Row-Level Security**: Database policies prevent unauthorized access

## API Endpoints

### Enhanced Endpoints
- `POST /api/upload` - Now stores images in Supabase Storage
- `GET /api/health` - Includes storage service health status

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/storage/cleanup` - Clean up old anonymous images
- `GET /api/storage/status` - Get user storage statistics (auth required)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Storage service health check passes
- [ ] Upload endpoint creates Supabase Storage URLs
- [ ] Images are accessible via public URLs
- [ ] Storage cleanup endpoint works
- [ ] Enhanced health endpoint shows storage status
- [ ] Frontend displays images correctly in history
- [ ] Anonymous images are stored in anonymous folder
- [ ] Authenticated user images are stored in user folders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Images not displaying in frontend:**
- Verify Supabase Storage bucket is public
- Check that storage policies are correctly applied
- Ensure image URLs are Supabase URLs (contain your project URL)

**Storage service health check fails:**
- Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env`
- Check Supabase project is active
- Ensure storage is enabled in Supabase dashboard

**Upload fails with storage error:**
- Check storage bucket exists and is named `outfit-images`
- Verify storage policies allow uploads
- Check file size limits (default: 50MB in Supabase)

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Test storage service
python test_storage.py

# Test API endpoints
python test_storage_endpoints.py

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Manual upload test
curl -X POST -F "file=@test_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/api/upload
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing local images continue to work via `/uploads/<filename>` route
- New uploads automatically use Supabase Storage
- Database sessions track both old and new image URLs

### Cleanup Strategy
- Anonymous images auto-delete after 24 hours
- User images persist until manually deleted
- Local temporary files are cleaned up after processing

## Performance Benefits

### Before (Local Storage)
- ❌ Images served from Flask server
- ❌ No CDN acceleration
- ❌ Cross-origin issues with frontend
- ❌ Manual cleanup required

### After (Supabase Storage)
- ✅ Images served from global CDN
- ✅ Automatic edge caching
- ✅ Direct browser access to images
- ✅ Automatic cleanup for anonymous users

## Security Improvements

### Before
- ❌ All uploaded images publicly accessible
- ❌ No user isolation
- ❌ Predictable file paths

### After
- ✅ Row-level security policies
- ✅ User-specific folders
- ✅ UUID-based file naming
- ✅ Anonymous image expiration

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Storage Usage**: Use Supabase dashboard to monitor storage usage
2. **Set Up Automated Cleanup**: Consider scheduled cleanup jobs for old anonymous images
3. **Image Optimization**: Consider adding image compression/resizing
4. **Error Monitoring**: Set up alerts for storage-related errors

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Run the test scripts to identify specific problems
3. Verify your Supabase configuration and permissions
4. Check the Flask server logs for detailed error messages

The implementation provides a solid foundation for scalable image storage while maintaining security and performance.
